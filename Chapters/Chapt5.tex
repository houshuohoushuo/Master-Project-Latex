We implement four CNN models, Small CNN, VGG, VGG-IN, and ResNet. We train these models on the US and PAT dataset, as well as IDC Breast Cancer dataset and Cats vs. Dogs dataset. The experimental results show that the performance of these models on the US and PAT dataset is poor. The number of samples in the US and PAT dataset is very limited comparing to the IDC Breast Cancer dataset and Dogs vs. Cats dataset. This could be a major cause of the poor performance. The experimental results also show that a deep neural network model, such as VGG, may encounter the degradation problem which prevents the network from training. ResNet, even though it may have the same depth as VGG, is able to overcome this problem by introducing shortcuts and match the performance of a shallower model. 

Future works:

1. When more US and PAT data is available, we could re-train the models. We have only considered class B and C, with more data belonging to other classes, we can expand the classification layer to predict more than two classes. In addition, we are expecting to see an improvement in accuracy with more data.

2. In this project, we use 2D CNN models to classify every slice of 3D images. We can use 3D CNN models to classify a 3D image (a specimen) as a whole. This will require more samples in each class, since we will not be able to split image stacks to create more data for each class.
