# McMaster Thesis Template

I worked from the General Thesis template on Overleaf (originally from [LaTeX Templates]("http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com") to create a McMaster specific format. 

Currently, the main.tex and the .cls file are needed to have full formatting, but I intend to wrap as much as I can in the .cls file.
