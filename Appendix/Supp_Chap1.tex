\chapter{Chapter 1 Supplement} % Main appendix title

\label{Supp_chap1}

Here is the supplemental file for chapter 1, as an alternative to including it in the main \TeX for chapter 1. This allows the figures/table to be numbered in a different way and for the section to be listed in the table of contents differently. 


\begin{figure}[h] % put figure roughly here, will float though
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figs/Wright_1932_1.pdf}
    \caption[Same Fig]{Same fig as before, but in the appendix!}
    \label{Another_fig}
\end{figure}
